## The Multi-Product Registry

Each insurance product plugs into a shared engine. The conversational flow, persistence,
result UI, PDF, and email are product-agnostic; a product only supplies its own questions,
first-question id, premium calculator, policy type label, and intro copy.

`src/data/products.ts` defines `ProductConfig` and the `PRODUCTS` map:

| Product (`id` / slug) | `policyType` | Questions | Calculator |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vacant-home` | `Vacant Home Insurance` | `QUESTIONS` | `calculateQuote` |
| `jeweller-block` | `Jeweller Block Insurance` | `JEWELLER_QUESTIONS` | `calculateJewellerQuote` |
| `farm` | `Farm Insurance` | `FARM_QUESTIONS` | `calculateFarmQuote` |
| `cyber-liability` | `Cyber Liability Insurance` | `CYBER_QUESTIONS` | `calculateCyberQuote` |
| `contractor` | `Contractor Insurance` | `CONTRACTOR_QUESTIONS` | `calculateContractorQuote` |
| `architects-engineers` | `Architects & Engineers Insurance` | `AE_QUESTIONS` | `calculateArchitectsEngineersQuote` |
| `retailers` | `Retailers Insurance` | `RETAIL_QUESTIONS` | `calculateRetailersQuote` |
| `rental-home` | `Rental Home Insurance` | `RENTAL_QUESTIONS` | `calculateRentalHomeQuote` |
| `personal-items` | `Personal Items Insurance` | `ITEMS_QUESTIONS` | `calculatePersonalItemsQuote` |
| `lithium-batteries` | `Lithium Battery Insurance` | `BATTERY_QUESTIONS` | `calculateLithiumBatteriesQuote` |

Helpers:

- `getProduct(productId)` — returns the config, falling back to `DEFAULT_PRODUCT_ID` (`vacant-home`) for unknown ids.
- `productSlugForPolicyType(policyType)` — reverse lookup used by the detail page's "Resume Quote" link to route a draft back to its product flow.

Each product page (`/new-quote/<slug>`) is a thin wrapper that renders `<QuoteExperience productId="…" />`. The category picker at `/new-quote` groups products into categories (incl. an **Agriculture** category for `farm`); each live product has an `href` and unbuilt ones render a "Coming Soon" badge. All ten products ship with comprehensive question sets, rating factors, and underwriting rules. `src/data/_allProductsRouting.test.ts` validates every product's flow end-to-end (routing integrity).

**Farm Insurance** is the most extensive flow: ~55 questions structured to mirror the paper application's modules (General Information, Locations, Habitational, Farm Buildings, Machinery & Equipment, Livestock, Earnings & Profits, Tank Data, Liability, Loss History, Property & Coverage, Broker Information), with conditional branches (oil-tank detail, bush cords, livestock skip, tank detail, loss detail) and decline/refer rules. Repeating tables (multiple locations/buildings/machinery/livestock/tanks) are captured as counts + aggregate values + the primary item in detail, since the chat engine is linear.

---

## Authentication & Route Protection

1. `src/middleware.ts` (`withAuth`) guards `/dashboard/*`, `/new-quote/*`, `/search/*` — no token → redirect to `/login`. An optional `SESSION_VERSION` env var invalidates stale dev sessions.
2. The `(protected)` layout *also* calls `getServerSession(authOptions)` and `redirect("/login")` server-side as a second gate (and covers `/policy/*`, `/review`, `/admin/*`).
3. Login posts to NextAuth's Credentials provider (`src/lib/auth.ts`), which looks up the `Broker` by email, **rejects inactive accounts** (`!broker.active`), and verifies the password with `bcrypt.compare`.
4. On success a signed JWT (8-hour `maxAge`) is issued; `id`, `name`, and **`role`** are copied onto the token and surfaced on `session.user`.
5. API route handlers individually call `getServerSession(authOptions)` and return `401`/`403` based on session and role.
6. `/pay/[token]` and `/api/pay/[token]` are **public** (no session) — the customer reaches them via a tokenised link emailed after a policy is bound.

### Roles & RBAC

The `Broker` model carries a `role` (`"ADMIN" | "BROKER" | "UNDERWRITER"`) and an `active` flag. `src/lib/access.ts` is the single source of truth for what each role can do:

| Helper | Rule |
|---|---|
| `submissionScopeWhere(user)` | `{ brokerId }` for BROKER; `{}` (all rows) for ADMIN/UNDERWRITER — reused by dashboard, search, list/admin/review queries |
| `canViewSubmission(user, sub)` | BROKER → own only; ADMIN/UNDERWRITER → any |
| `canReview(user)` | ADMIN/UNDERWRITER (approve/decline referred quotes) |
| `canBindOrPay(user, sub)` | owning BROKER or ADMIN |
| `canManageUsers(user)` | ADMIN only |
| `requireRole(session, roles[])` | server-page guard; redirects to `/login` (no session) or `/dashboard` (wrong role) |

**Role landings:** BROKER → `/dashboard`, UNDERWRITER → `/review`, ADMIN → `/admin` (the dashboard page redirects the latter two). The `Header` renders role-specific nav and an Action Required badge for brokers. `access.ts`'s pure helpers are covered by `src/lib/access.test.ts`.

**Role-scoped list pages.** Beyond the dashboard, several paginated list pages share the same scoping and typeahead pattern:

| Page | Scope | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| `/policies` | role-scoped | bound policies only (`PolicySearchBox`) |
| `/customers` | role-scoped | Client-360 grouped by email/name (`CustomerSearchBox`) |
| `/search` | role-scoped (underwriter = policies-only) | all submissions, filters incl. Stage (quote/policy) |
| `/reviews` | ADMIN/UNDERWRITER | all decisions (`SubmissionSearchBox`) |
| `/queue` | ADMIN/UNDERWRITER | all pending referrals, oldest-first with aging |
| `/review` | ADMIN/UNDERWRITER | overview (`ReviewStats`) + aging pending queue |
| `/admin` | ADMIN | portfolio analytics (`AdminAnalytics`, top brokers by premium) |
| `/admin/users` | ADMIN | search, reset-password, role/active toggle |

Each list-search input is backed by a case-insensitive (`mode: "insensitive"`) suggest API: `/api/policies/suggest`, `/api/customers/suggest`, `/api/reviews/suggest`, `/api/queue/suggest`. The broker dashboard and these pages can export the current role-scoped view as CSV via `GET /api/submissions/export` (underwriter exports are forced to bound policies).

### Demo accounts

All demo accounts use password `Demo1234!`:

| Role | Email |
|---|---|
| Admin | `admin@demo.com` |
| Underwriter | `underwriter@demo.com` |
| Broker | `broker@demo.com`, `harpreet.singh@insureflow.com` |

Run `npm run db:seed` to create them. (The login page no longer displays demo credentials.)

---

## The Four Quote Phases

The quote flow is a state machine driven by `AppPhase` in `QuoteContext`. `QuoteShell`
(`QuoteExperience.tsx`) switches on `phase` inside an `AnimatePresence`:

```
"intro" → "conversation" → "summary" → "result"
```

| From | To | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `intro` | `conversation` | `startConversation()` (Intro screen CTA) |
| `conversation` | `summary` | `submitAnswer` re-walks the path and reaches `__SUBMIT__` |
| `summary` | `result` | `confirmSummary()` — runs the calculator |
| `summary`/`result` | `conversation` | `goToQuestion()` (edit an answer) returns to chat |

The `QuestionProgressRail` (a vertical section stepper) is shown beside the shell during
`conversation` and `summary`, and reads `complete` during `summary`/`result`.

---

## Component Tree

```
<QuoteExperience productId>            ← page-level wrapper
  <QuoteProvider productId>            ← global state for one product
    <QuoteShell>

## State Management — QuoteContext

All cross-component quote state lives in `src/context/QuoteContext.tsx`. The provider takes a
`productId` and resolves its config once via `useRef(getProduct(productId))`, so `questions`,
`firstQuestionId`, `policyType`, `intro`, and `calculate` are fixed for the lifetime of the flow.

### State

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `phase` | Current screen (`AppPhase`) |
| `answers` | `Record<questionId, { questionId, value, displayValue }>` |
| `currentQuestionId` | Question the user is on |
| `questionHistory` | Ordered ids on the *current* answered path |
| `conversationMessages` | Broker + user chat bubbles |
| `quoteDetails` | Result of `product.calculate(answers)` |
| `submissionId` | DB id, set after the async save resolves |

`progress` and `canGoBack` are derived from `questionHistory.indexOf(currentQuestionId)`.
A `sessionId` and `draftIdRef` (both refs) track the auto-saved draft.

### Functions

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `startConversation()` | `phase → "conversation"` |
| `submitAnswer(id, value, displayValue, extra?)` | Records the answer (+ any derived `extra`), re-walks the path, advances or submits |
| `addBrokerMessage(text, questionId)` | Appends a broker bubble (called after the typing delay) |
| `goBack()` | Steps to the previous history id; hides messages from there on but **keeps** answers |
| `goToQuestion(targetId)` | Jumps to any visited question to edit it; hides messages from the target on, keeps answers, returns to `conversation` |
| `confirmSummary()` | Calculates the quote, shows the result, promotes the draft to a complete submission |
| `resumeFromDraft(savedAnswers, draftId)` | Rebuilds history + chat from a saved draft |
| `restart()` | Resets all state |

### Routing helpers

- `resolveNextQuestionId(questions, id, value, answers)` — evaluates `conditionalBranches`
  (each branch can compare the current value or another answer's value) and falls back to
  `defaultNextQuestionId`, or `"__SUBMIT__"`.
- `walkAnsweredPath(questions, answers, firstQuestionId)` — starting from the first question,
  follows `resolveNextQuestionId` through every *answered* question and returns the ordered
  `path` plus a `stopId` (the first unanswered question, or `"__SUBMIT__"`). This is the core
  of the edit/preservation behavior below.

---

## The Answer-Preservation / Edit Flow

This is the most subtle part of the app. When a broker edits an earlier answer (via the
Summary screen's Edit button, the in-chat AI "change an answer" box, or Go back), later
answers should **survive** if they're still reachable, and only answers that fall off a
changed branch should be **pruned**.

`submitAnswer` implements this:

1. Merge the new answer (and any `extra` derived answers) into the existing `answers`.
2. Call `walkAnsweredPath` to recompute the reachable, answered path from the start.
3. Keep only answers whose ids are on that path; drop the rest (`pathSet` filter). This is
   what prunes now-unreachable answers when a branch changes.
4. Set `questionHistory = path`.
5. Auto-save a draft once `≥ 3` answers exist (`POST /api/drafts`).
6. For the questions *between* the edited one and the resume point that are already answered,
   re-emit their broker + user chat bubbles so the transcript stays coherent without forcing
   the broker to re-answer them.
7. If `stopId === "__SUBMIT__"`, go to `summary`; otherwise set `currentQuestionId = stopId`.

`goBack` and `goToQuestion` deliberately **keep** answers and only hide the chat messages from
the chosen point onward — so when the broker moves forward again, downstream questions are
already answered and auto-replay rather than starting blank.

`ConversationView` cooperates with this: when its typing effect fires for a question whose
broker bubble is *already* in `conversationMessages`, it skips the typing delay and reveals
the input immediately.

## Data → Engine → Persistence → View

```
ANSWER SUBMITTED (InputRenderer → ConversationView.handleSubmit)
   └─ submitAnswer(): merge → walkAnsweredPath → prune → history → draft autosave

"Calculate My Quote" (SummaryScreen)
   └─ confirmSummary():
        product.calculate(answers) → quoteDetails   (runs UW engine + pricing)
        phase = "result"                            (shown immediately)
        POST /api/submissions { answers, quoteDetails, draftId, policyType }
            → promotes the draft (or creates) → setSubmissionId(id)   (non-blocking)

"Buy This Policy" (AcceptResult / BuyPolicyButton)
   └─ POST /api/buy-policy { submissionId }
        → canBindOrPay ownership check; decision must be "accept"; not already paid
        → set purchased = true; stamp effectiveAt/expiresAt (12-month term);
          generate paymentToken (idempotent)
        → sendPaymentRequestEmail() to the APPLICANT with a /pay/<token> link
        → optional sendUnderwriterNotificationEmail() on first bind
        → { success, sentTo, previewUrl }   (broker sees "payment link sent")
        (calling again on a bound-but-unpaid policy resends the link)

Customer pays (public — no login)  /pay/<token>
   └─ POST /api/pay/[token] { cardNumber, expiry, cvc }
        → validate card format only (NO real charge)
        → set paymentStatus = "paid", paidAt, paidAmount
        → sendPolicyConfirmationEmail() + sendPaymentReceiptEmail() to applicant
        → { success, previewUrl }

Underwriter review (referred quotes)  /review → /policy/[id]
   └─ POST /api/submissions/[id]/review { action: approve|decline, note }
        → canReview; submission must be decision = "refer"
        → set decision (accept|decline) + reviewedById/reviewedAt/reviewNote
        → on approve → sendQuoteApprovedEmail() to the broker

Mid-term adjustment (paid, non-cancelled)  /policy/[id] (AdjustPolicyButton)
   └─ POST /api/submissions/[id]/adjust { coverageAmount, reason }
        → canBindOrPay ownership check; must be purchased AND paymentStatus = "paid" and not cancelled
        → newAnnual = oldAnnual × newCoverage / oldCoverage (premium scales with sum insured)
        → proRata = (newAnnual − oldAnnual) × remainingDays / termDays (effectiveAt→expiresAt)
        → update coverageAmount/annualPremium/monthlyPremium; append an MTA record to adjustments[]
        → sendAdjustmentEmail() to the applicant → { success, newAnnual, oldAnnual, proRata, remainingDays, sentTo, previewUrl }

Cancellation (paid policy)  /policy/[id] (CancelPolicyButton)
   └─ POST /api/submissions/[id]/cancel { reason }
        → canBindOrPay ownership check; must be purchased AND paymentStatus = "paid" and not already cancelled
        → stamp cancelledAt + cancelReason
        → sendCancellationEmail() to the applicant → { success, sentTo, previewUrl }
```

The full policy lifecycle is: **quote → (refer → AI review/approve) → bind → pay → adjust (MTA) → cancel.**

`brokerText` shown in the chat is run through `interpolate()` to substitute `{{answer_id}}`
placeholders with prior `displayValue`s.

## The Underwriting & Pricing Engines

### Underwriting (`src/engine/underwritingEngine.ts`)

`runUnderwritingEngine(answers, questions)` walks every question's `underwritingRules`,
applying a `compare()` over operators (`equals`, `not_equals`, `greater_than[_or_equal]`,
`less_than[_or_equal]`, `contains`, `in_list`). Triggered rules push a decline or referral
reason. **Decline takes precedence over Refer**, and either takes precedence over Accept.
The engine is shared; each calculator passes its own product's question set.

### Pricing

Both calculators run the UW engine, then build a `factors[]` breakdown and a `QuoteDetails`
result (decision + reasons + premiums + coverage + factors).

- **Vacant Home** (`quoteCalculator.ts`): multiplicative — `BASE_PREMIUM` × province ×
  vacancy duration × property type × replacement-cost (dynamic) × age × inspection ×
  security × claims × deductible × coverage %, then flat surcharges (unfenced pool, known
  damage, coverage lapse, active utilities). Coverage amount = property value × coverage %.
- **Jeweller Block** (`jewellerQuoteCalculator.ts`): sum-insured driven — base = max stock
  value × `JEWELLER_BASE_RATE`, then business type × province × years trading × % in safe ×
  safe grade × alarm × window exposure × (off-site, only if carried) × losses × deductible,
  plus flat loadings (high window value, transit). Coverage amount = max stock value.
- **Farm** (`farmQuoteCalculator.ts`): sum-insured driven — base = total sum insured ×
  `FARM_BASE_RATE`, then operation type × province × experience × revenue × dwelling
  age/construction/roof/wiring/plumbing/heating × solid-fuel heat × fire-protection/security/pool
  × building schedule × liability limit × loss history × deductible, plus flat loadings
  (certified wood heat, agritourism, livestock bailee). Coverage amount = total sum insured.
- **Other products** (cyber, contractor, AE, retailers, rental, personal items, lithium batteries)
  follow the same sum-insured/exposure-driven pattern in their own `…QuoteCalculator.ts`.

Factors with `multiplier !== 1` or a positive `adjustment` are rendered in the breakdown UI;
the engine result's `decision` selects the Accept/Decline/Refer screen.

## Drafts, Submissions & Broker Isolation

A single `Submission` row models both drafts and completed quotes/policies, distinguished by
`status` (`"draft"` | `"complete"`) and `purchased` (quote vs. bound policy).

- **Drafts** — `POST /api/drafts` upserts a row (`status: "draft"`) once `submitAnswer`
  collects 3+ answers. The detail page offers "Resume Quote" (`/new-quote/<slug>?resume=<id>`);
  `QuoteShell` reads `?resume`, `GET /api/drafts/[id]`, and calls `resumeFromDraft`.
- **Submissions** — `POST /api/submissions` writes typed columns (extracted by question id),
  the full `allAnswers` JSON blob, the decision, premiums, and reason arrays. If a `draftId`
  exists it updates that row to `status: "complete"`; otherwise it creates one.
- **Role-based access** — every detail/search/list/PDF/buy query goes through `src/lib/access.ts`
  (`submissionScopeWhere` / `canViewSubmission` / `canBindOrPay`). Brokers are scoped to
  `brokerId === session.user.id`; admins and underwriters see all brokers' submissions.
  `DELETE /api/submissions/[id]` allows the owning broker or an admin and refuses to delete a
  `purchased` (bound) policy with `409`.

### Underwriter Review & Payment

- **Review** — referred quotes (`decision = "refer"`) collect in `/review` (underwriter/admin,
  all brokers). Opening one shows `ReviewActions`; `POST /api/submissions/[id]/review` flips the
  decision to accept/decline, stamps `reviewedById`/`reviewedAt`/`reviewNote`, and emails the
  broker on approval. The broker then sees an **Action Required** item on their dashboard.
- **AI recommendation (advisory)** — `ReviewActions` has a "Get AI Recommendation" button →
  `POST /api/submissions/[id]/ai-review` (underwriter/admin, refer-only). It returns a typed
  verdict — `approve`/`decline` + confidence + 2–5 reasons — rendered as an "AI Suggestion" card
  and used to pre-fill the review note; the human still confirms. The engine is **pluggable** via
  the `UnderwriterEngine` interface in `src/lib/aiUnderwriter.ts`; the active engine is an inline
  OpenAI call (`gpt-4o-mini`, JSON output, funded by `OPENAI_API_KEY`). A future Anthropic
  Agent-Skill engine (render submission → PDF → Files API → custom Skill + code execution) can be
  dropped in by swapping `activeEngine` without touching the route or UI. Gated by
  `isAiUnderwriterConfigured()` (`503` "not configured" without the key).
- **Payment** — pressing Buy binds the policy and emails the *applicant* a tokenised
  `/pay/<token>` link (`paymentToken` is a unique column). The customer pays on the public page
  with a card form that is **format-validated only — no real charge** (a real gateway can be
  swapped into `/api/pay/[token]` later). On success `paymentStatus` becomes `"paid"` and the
  applicant receives a confirmation + receipt. A bound-but-unpaid policy can have its link
  resent from the policy page or dashboard. The Buy / Resend action is a prominent **call-to-action
  banner near the top** of the policy detail page ("Ready to bind" for an accepted-unbound quote;
  "Awaiting customer payment" for a bound-but-unpaid policy), not in the bottom actions row.
- **Mid-term adjustment & cancellation (paid only)** — both `/api/submissions/[id]/adjust` and
  `/cancel` require the policy to be bound **and** paid (`purchased && paymentStatus === "paid"`)
  and not already cancelled; the policy page only renders the Adjust / Cancel buttons for a paid,
  non-cancelled policy.
- **Cancelled policies** — a cancelled policy shows a red **"Cancelled"** badge (`CancelledBadge`)
  in place of the Paid/Unpaid pill across the broker dashboard, Policies, Customers, Search, and the
  admin Recent Activity. The dashboard has a dedicated **Cancelled Policies** section (after Recent
  Policies); Recent Policies lists only active (non-cancelled) policies, and cancelled policies are
  excluded from **Upcoming Renewals** and from a customer's active-premium / next-renewal totals.
- **Policy term & renewals** — binding stamps `effectiveAt`/`expiresAt` (12-month term) on the
  `Submission`; the dashboard's **Upcoming Renewals** derives from `expiresAt` (cancelled policies excluded).

## PDF Generation

`GET /api/policy/[id]/document` (Node runtime) authorizes the broker, optionally fetches a
Google **Static Maps** PNG and inlines it as a base64 data URI, builds the detail sections via
`buildSubmissionSections`, and calls `renderPolicyPdf` (`src/lib/policyPdf.tsx`,
`@react-pdf/renderer`) to stream an `application/pdf` attachment. This is pure Node — no
headless browser.

`buildSubmissionSections` (`src/lib/submissionSections.ts`) is product-aware: Vacant Home
renders from typed columns; other products (Jeweller Block) render generically from the
`allAnswers` JSON, grouped by each question's `summarySection` and labeled by `summaryLabel`.
The same builder feeds the on-screen detail page (`policy/[id]/page.tsx`) and the PDF.

---

## Email Flow

`src/lib/email.ts` builds a Nodemailer transport: real SMTP when `SMTP_USER` + `SMTP_PASS`
are set, otherwise an auto-created **Ethereal** test account that returns a browser
`previewUrl`. It exposes these templated senders:

- `sendPaymentRequestEmail` — applicant-facing "complete your payment" with the `/pay/<token>`
  link and amount due. Sent by `/api/buy-policy` after the policy is bound.
- `sendPolicyConfirmationEmail` — applicant-facing confirmation (premium summary, app id).
  Sent by `/api/pay/[token]` after payment succeeds.
- `sendPaymentReceiptEmail` — applicant-facing receipt (amount, date). Sent on payment success.
- `sendQuoteApprovedEmail` — broker-facing notice that a referred quote was approved and is
  ready to bind. Sent by the review endpoint.
- `sendUnderwriterNotificationEmail` — best-effort back-office notice on first bind, only when
  `UNDERWRITER_EMAIL` is set; failures never block the bind.
- `sendAdjustmentEmail` — applicant-facing notice of a mid-term adjustment (old/new coverage,
  old/new premium, pro-rata charge/return). Sent by `/api/submissions/[id]/adjust`.
- `sendCancellationEmail` — applicant-facing cancellation confirmation (effective date, reason).
  Sent by `/api/submissions/[id]/cancel`.

All senders use the same Ethereal/SMTP transport and return `{ sentTo, previewUrl }`.
The buy/review/pay/adjust/cancel UIs surface the recipient and, in Ethereal mode, an "Open … email" button
(`previewUrl`).

## AI Features

Both use `gpt-4o-mini` and short-circuit with a "not configured" message when
`OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing.

### Help Navigator — `POST /api/help-chat`

`HelpChatWidget` (floating, on every protected page). On each request the server reads every
`.md`/`.txt`/`.pdf` in `knowledge/` (skipping `README`, capped at `KB_CHAR_LIMIT`), parses
PDFs via `pdf-parse`, and injects them as system context alongside a portal description. It is
tuned to answer insurance policy-wording questions and only declines truly unrelated topics.
No restart is needed when knowledge files change. The `knowledge/` folder includes per-product
FAQs (incl. `farm-faq.md`) and portal guides — `getting-started`, `broker-guide`,
`underwriter-guide`, `admin-guide`, `ai-underwriter`, `payments-binding-renewals`, `portal-faq`.

### Change-an-Answer — `POST /api/chat-intent`

The bottom of `ConversationView`'s input area (shown once ≥ 1 answer exists). The broker types
a natural-language request; the model is sent the answered questions and returns
`{ questionId, reply }` as JSON. The view shows the reply, then calls `goToQuestion(questionId)`
to rewind to that question for re-answering.

## Maps & Address Autocomplete

`src/utils/googleMaps.ts` lazily loads the Google Maps JS API with the Places library, gated
on `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` (returns `null` with no key so callers degrade to plain
inputs). It also builds `mapEmbedUrl` (iframe preview) and `staticMapUrl` (PNG for the PDF).

`inputs/AddressInput.tsx` attaches a Places `Autocomplete` (restricted to Canada). On select
it captures `formatted_address` and derives the province from the
`administrative_area_level_1` component, passing it up as an `extra` derived answer
(`property_province`) so it persists atomically with the address. A live map iframe previews
the selected address.

---

## PWA & Dynamic Icons

- `src/app/manifest.ts` — dynamic web manifest (`start_url: /dashboard`, standalone,
  portrait, theme color `#4f46e5`), referencing `/pwa-icon/192` and `/pwa-icon/512`.
- `src/app/pwa-icon/[size]/route.tsx` — edge route that renders an "IF Portal" icon at any
  requested size via `ImageResponse`.
- `src/app/icon.tsx` / `apple-icon.tsx` — dynamic favicon and Apple touch icon.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — sets `manifest`, `appleWebApp`, and viewport metadata.

## Adding a New Product

1. Add a question set (and any rating factors) under `src/data/` — give each question a
   `summarySection`/`summaryLabel` so the generic section builder and progress rail work.
2. Write a `calculate(answers): QuoteDetails` that calls `runUnderwritingEngine(answers, yourQuestions)`.
3. Register it in `PRODUCTS` (`src/data/products.ts`) with an `id` slug, `policyType`,
   `firstQuestionId`, `calculate`, and `intro`.
4. Add `src/app/(protected)/new-quote/<slug>/page.tsx` rendering `<QuoteExperience productId="<slug>" />`,
   and link it from the category picker.
5. The shared engine, persistence (`allAnswers` JSON), detail page, PDF, and email work without further changes.
